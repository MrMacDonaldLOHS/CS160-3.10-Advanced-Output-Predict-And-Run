# Task - Predict and Run

This task contains examples of more advanced printing. This code features:
- Printing comma separated lists.
- Modifying the spacing between list items.
- Modifying how we end each print.
- Formatting float output to add precision

This code also uses the escape character \n which makes the separator a newline. If you would like to learn more about escape characters, click [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_escape_characters.asp).

As always, you are not graded on the accuracy of your predictions. Making a prediction and then checking your answer is a great way to learn!






## Help! My Code Doesn't Work!

Make sure that you check for the following things:

- You have put the parenthesis after the input command `()`
- You have typed the variable name **exactly** the same (including caps), every time
- There is a variable on the **left** of each assignment
- You have used a single **=** for assignment
- You have used the **+** symbol to concatenate (join).
- All of your indentation is correct.
- You concatenated numbers using `str(number)`
- You remembered to convert the `input` using `int()` or `float()`
